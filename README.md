**Technologies Used**
- Java
- Java Swing for GUI components
- Object-Oriented Design Patterns
<br>

**Learning  Outcomes:**

- This project helped me develop skills in:
- GUI programming with Java Swing
- Event handling and user interaction
- Game state management
- Object-oriented design principles
- Software testing and debugging

<br>

**Note on Code Sharing:**
- In accordance with academic integrity policies, the complete source code is not publicly available. Screenshots and code snippets have been modified to comply with university guidelines while still demonstrating the project's functionality and design.
<br>

**User Interaction:**

    - The user attempts to replicate the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the correct order.
    - The user's clicks are tracked and compared against the `gamePattern` to determine success or failure.

<br>

**UI Elements:**

    - Level Title: Displays the current level of the game.
    - Colored Buttons: Interactive elements that the user clicks in sequence.

<br>

**Press any key to start the game. The game level is displayed, and a sequence of colors is generated. Click on the buttons in the correct order to repeat the sequence. Each button click triggers an animation and a sound effect. If the sequence is correct, the game level increases, and a new sequence is generated. If the sequence is incorrect, the game ends.**
